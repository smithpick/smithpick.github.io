# Techboard

Teacher-only display board. Open `index.html` (or https://smithpick.github.io) and project it.

## Weekly plan
`plans.js` has one block per week, keyed by that week's Monday. The board opens to the newest week that has started, so next week can be added ahead of time and it switches on its own Monday. Old weeks stay in the file and in the week menu.

Each item:
- `label`: short text on the button
- `type`: `"guide"` opens a guide from `guides.js`, `"steps"` opens a page full screen, `"link"` opens a new tab
- `url` or `guide`: what it opens. Leave `url` as `""` if the link isn't ready.

"All pages" lists every guide and every page or link used in any week.

## Step guides
New guides go in `guides.js`, pictures in `guides/<guide id>/`. Old guides stay in the list and show under "All pages" on the board.
In a guide: Next/Back, "Show all" for the wall of cards, "Big" for one picture at a time.
